\chorus{If I were a blackbird, I'd whistle and sing,
I'd follow the vessel my true love sails in,
And on the top riggings, I'd there build my nest,
And lay there all night on his lily white breast.}

\verse{I am a young maiden and my story is sad,
For once I was courted by a brave sailor lad,
He courted me strongly by night and by day,
But now my dear sailor is gone far away.}

\verse{He promised to take me to Donnybrook fair,
To buy me red ribbons to tie up my hair,
And when he'd return from the ocean so wide,
He'd take me and make me his own loving bride.}

\verse{His parents they slight me and will not agree,
That I and my sailor boy married should be,
But when he comes home I will greet him with joy,
And I'll take to my bosom my dear sailor boy.}
