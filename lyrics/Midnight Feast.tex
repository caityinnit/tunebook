\verse{I never thought I'd find life easy,
I was lately falling apart.
Then you came, and then you made me
Lean that bit harder on my heart.}

\chorus{Aren't you just ravenous for a midnight feast.
Old drooling moon is shining down on us
At the end of the street.
I'm damned if I do my love, damned if I don't my sweet.
Dare I declare this morning's love turned evening deep.}

\verse{Well we went down the road, got soaked in moonlight,
Hedged in roses on either side.
And all was in our ears was the sound of the ocean,
All was in the distance was an indigo sky.}

\verse{Come away with me, or leave me.
Come nearer me or go away.
Just the sound of your breathing,
Come a feeling worth feeling.
Come a summer's evening at the close of day.}
