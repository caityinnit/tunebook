\verse{On the first day of Christmas my true love sent to me
A worn out McCalman's LP.}

\verse{On the second day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Two botched up bookings...}

\verse{On the third day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Three ageing hippies...}

\verse{On the fourth day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Four fumbling fiddlers...}

\verse{On the fifth day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Steeleye Span...}

\verse{On the sixth day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Six Spinners' harmonies...}

\verse{On the seventh day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Seven drunken nights...}

\verse{On the eighth day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Eight Tibetan nose flute players who have had an unfortunate cancellation, any chance of a booking? ...}

\verse{On the ninth day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Nine Corries' concerts...}

\verse{On the tenth day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Ten tanked-up hecklers,
``Get on with it, geez 'The Flower of Scotland'!"
Oh flower of Scotland, ...}

\verse{On the eleventh day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Eleven lawyer's letters.}

\verse{On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love sent to me,
Twelve months to go till the next Christmas meal,
Eleven lawyer's letters,
Ten tanked-up hecklers,
``Get on with it, geez 'The Flower of Scotland'!",
Oh flower of Scotland,
Nine Corries' concerts,
Eight Tibetan nose flute players who have had an unfortunate cancellation, any chance of a booking?
Seven drunken nights,
Six Spinners' harmonies,
Steeleye Span,
Four fumbling fiddlers,
Three ageing hippies,
Two botched up bookings,
And a worn out-
And a worn out-
And a worn out McCalman's LP.}
