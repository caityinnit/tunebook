\verse{Oh the summer time has come
And the trees are sweetly blooming.
And wild mountain thyme
Grows around the blooming heather.
Will you go, lassie, go?}

\chorus{And we'll all go together 
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather. 
Will you go, lassie, go?}

\verse{I will build my love a tower
By yon clear crystal fountain, 
And on it I will pile
All the flowers of the mountain. 
Will you go, lassie, go?}

\verse{I will range through the wilds
And the deep land so dreary
And return with the spoils
To the bower o' my dearie.
Will ye go, lassie, go?}

\verse{If my true love she'll not come
Then I'll surely find another
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather. 
Will you go, lassie, go?}
